## programming paradigms
a fancy title to describe popular ways or styles to organize your programming.

## Notes: 📝
- For the sake of simplicity, i will user PP as a short of Programming Paradigm.

# What is a Programming Paradigm? 🚩✅
- Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized.
- There are various Programming Paradigms because it depends on the project you are wokring on and the programmer's preferences.
- These Paradigms were developed overtime.

  
# What a Programming Paradigm is Not? 🚩✅
.
- PP is a set of ideals and guidelines that many people have agreen on, followed and expanded upon.
- You can only use one PP at a time when using a certain Programming Language.

# What are the Benefits of Programming Paradigms? 🚩✅
### Each PP has it's own benefits and advanteges, OOP for example: 📄
- Encapsulation: Data and behavior are encapsulated within objects, enhancing data security and reducing complexity.
- Reusability: Classes and inheritance promote code reuse, saving development time.
- Maintenance: Easier to maintain and extend, as changes can be localized within cl

# Popular Programming Paradigms 🚩✅
- Note that we will demonstrate most popular PPs but not all of them, Starting with the Imperative Programming

## 1. Imperative Programming 📍
- Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates, step by step.

## 2. Procedural Programming 📍
- Procedural programming is a derivation of imperative programming, adding to it the feature of functions
- Imperative Programming BUT with funcitons, the code is the same.

## 3. Functional Programming 📍
- Functional programming takes the concept of functions a little bit further.
- In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

## 4. Imperative Programming 📍
- Declarative programming is all about hiding away complexity and bringing programming languages closer to human language and thinking.
- Applying the Encapsulation of the OOP programming paradigm. Show the feature clearly without showing the funcitonlit, Show What but Not how.
- You drive a car, but you does not how the car Works as a whole.

## 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 📍
- The core concept of OOP is to separate concerns into entities which are coded as objects.
- Each entity will group a given set of information (properties) and actions (methods) that can be performed by the entity.


# Round Up ✍️
- Imperative, procedural, functional, declarative, and object oriented paradigms are some of the most popular and widely used paradigms today. - And knowing the basics about them is good for general knowledge and also for better understanding other topics of the coding world.
