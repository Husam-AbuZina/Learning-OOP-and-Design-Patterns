## programming paradigms
a fancy title to describe popular ways or styles to organize your programming.

## Notes:
- For the sake of simplicity, i will user PP as a short of Programming Paradigm.
- This Article is Quoted from FreeCodeCamp, But i try to summarize it as much as posssible for fellow GitHub Friends.

# What is a Programming Paradigm?
- Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized.
- There are various Programming Paradigms because it depends on the project you are wokring on and the programmer's preferences.
- These Paradigms were developed overtime.

  
# What a Programming Paradigm is Not?0
.
- PP is a set of ideals and guidelines that many people have agreen on, followed and expanded upon.
- You can only use one PP at a time when using a certain Programming Language.

# What are the Benefits of Programming Paradigms?
### Each PP has it's own benefits and advanteges, OOP for example:
- Encapsulation: Data and behavior are encapsulated within objects, enhancing data security and reducing complexity.
- Reusability: Classes and inheritance promote code reuse, saving development time.
- Maintenance: Easier to maintain and extend, as changes can be localized within cl

# Popular Programming Paradigms
- Note that we will demonstrate most popular PPs but not all of them, Starting with the Imperative Programming

## 1. Imperative Programming
- Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates, step by step.
