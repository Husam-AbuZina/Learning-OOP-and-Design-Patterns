# Using OOP concepts to write high-performance Java code (2023)

## List of OOP concepts in Java:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Association

- Composition

# What are OOP concepts in Java?
 - Object-oriented programming focuses on objects made up of both data (fields) and code (properties or attributes). 
 - Java supports object-oriented programming
    
# Advantages of OOP
- Classes provide easy “building blocks” for faster coding and make code highly maintainable
- Create more stable and consistent code
- Make large and complex code bases more efficient and manageable
- Teams working from the same code base will benefit from existing well-written classes
- Java in particular enforces OOP, which creates good habits (but may be challenging for beginners)
