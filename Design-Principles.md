# Design-Principles

## SOLID, Stands For:

- The Single Responsibility Principle
- The Open-Closed Principle
- The Liskov Substitution Principle
- The Interface Segregation Principle
- The Dependency Inversion Principle
- 

## 1. The Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

To state this principle more technically: Only one potential change (database logic, logging logic, and so on.) in the softwareâ€™s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
