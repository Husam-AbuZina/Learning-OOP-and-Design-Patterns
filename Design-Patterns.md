# Design Patterns

##  What's a design pattern?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: 
you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.
