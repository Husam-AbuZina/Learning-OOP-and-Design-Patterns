# Design Patterns

##  What's a design pattern?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: 
you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## What does the pattern consist of?
- Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- Code example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

## History of patterns
Who invented patterns? That’s a good, but not a very accurate, question. Design patterns aren’t obscure, sophisticated concepts—quite the opposite. Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design. When a solution gets repeated over and over in various projects, someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the solution in detail. That’s basically how a pattern gets discovered.

## Why should I learn patterns?
- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion. No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name

## Criticism of patterns
1. Kludges for a weak programming language
   Usually the need for patterns arises when people choose a programming language or a technology that lacks the necessary level of abstraction.
2. Inefficient solutions
   Patterns try to systematize approaches that are already widely used.
3. Unjustified use
Having learned about patterns, they try to apply them everywhere, even in situations where simpler code would do just fine.

## Classification of patterns
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. 
### Some Patterns Types:
1. Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2. Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
